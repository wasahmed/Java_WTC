//        An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€”it may or may not include abstract methods.
//        Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed,
//        the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class.
